# Loan-Default-Risk-Management-
In order to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan, using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions.

# Business Objectives
The case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

# Basic Terms
Bank loan-an amount of money loaned at interest by a bank to a borrower, usually on collateral security, for a certain period of time.

A loan is the money you receive from a bank or financial institution in exchange for a commitment to repay the principal amount with interest. Since lenders take the risk of a possible default, they charge a fee to offset this risk â€“ and this fee is known as the interest. Loans typically are secured or unsecured.

Banks typically require a borrower to have good or excellent credit (690 or higher FICO), multiple years of credit history and a low debt-to-income ratio to take out a personal loan. If you don't think you'll qualify for a bank loan, look for ways to improve your credit or consider a co-signed or secured loan.

Cash loan is a type of personal loan which requires minimum documentation and the approval process is quick and speedy. The method is minimal and convenient compared to the traditional bank loans. Cash loans are also termed as personal loan, instant loan, money loan or quick loan.

Revolving loan facility is a form of credit issued by a financial institution that provides the borrower with the ability to draw down or withdraw, repay, and withdraw again. A revolving loan is considered a flexible financing tool due to its repayment and re-borrowing accommodations. It is not considered a term loan because, during an allotted period of time, the facility allows the borrower to repay the loan or take it out again. In contrast, a term loan provides a borrower with funds followed by a fixed payment schedule.
